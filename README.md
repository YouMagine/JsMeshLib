This program can convert large ASCII STL files into binary meshes, which in turn can be compressed before they are uploaded.

To start with it only supports the STL file format. Compression is TBD.

 - Include Ultimaker's STL importer lib
 - Create a bin STL writer in JS
 - Implement pre-upload zipping
 - Create server side tool for receiving a file
 - Possibly support other types of Meshes
 - Simplify meshes if lossy is accepted

== DONE ==
 - Setup initial project stucture and github repo
 - Setup code stubs
